# Tree folder structure

- Based on the object named files provided in main.js
    - create a tree structure. 
    - if a node contains children it's children should 
        also be represented in a tree structure.
    - by default all nodes should be collapsed.
    - once you click on a parent node it should expand
    - if parent node is expanded and you click on it, it should collapse.
